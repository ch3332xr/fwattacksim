Overview
The ch3332xr project is a comprehensive security testing tool that allows users to simulate a variety of network and cybersecurity attacks in a controlled environment. It offers functionalities such as brute force attacks, denial of service (DoS), replay attacks, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and DNS tunneling.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/ch3332xr/fwattacksim.git


Features
Brute Force Attack using Hydra
DoS Attack using Hping3
Replay Attack using Tcpreplay
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack using Ettercap
DNS Tunneling using dnscat2
ASCII Art branding for every execution!
Requirements
To run this script, you will need the following tools installed on your system:

Hydra
Hping3
Tcpreplay
Ettercap
dnscat2
Installing Dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hydra hping3 tcpreplay ettercap-text-only
For dnscat2, you'll need to install it from the source:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2.git
cd dnscat2
make
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ch3332xr/fwattacksim.git
cd fwattacksim
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x attack-script.sh
Install the required tools using the commands provided in the "Requirements" section.

Usage
To launch the attack script, run:

bash
Copy code
./attack-script.sh
The script will present you with a menu to choose the type of attack:

bash
Copy code
Select an attack type:
1) Brute Force
2) Denial of Service (DoS)
3) Replay Attack
4) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
5) DNS Tunneling
Simply enter the corresponding number for the attack you'd like to perform, and follow the on-screen instructions.

Example: Brute Force Attack
vbnet
Copy code
Launching brute force attack on firewall...
Please enter the target IP address: 192.168.1.100
Please enter the port to attack (e.g., 22 for SSH): 22
Please enter the path to your wordlist for brute force: /path/to/wordlist.txt
Attacks Included
1. Brute Force Attack
Tool: Hydra
Description: Tries various username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access to a service.
2. DoS Attack
Tool: Hping3
Description: Floods the target system with packets to cause a denial of service.
3. Replay Attack
Tool: Tcpreplay
Description: Replays previously captured traffic to mimic legitimate network activity.
4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
Tool: Ettercap
Description: Spoofs ARP requests to intercept communications between devices on the network.
5. DNS Tunneling Attack
Tool: dnscat2
Description: Uses DNS queries to exfiltrate data from the target system.
How It Works
Each attack is launched through a specific tool, with inputs provided by the user. The tools are widely recognized for penetration testing and are available in most Linux distributions or can be compiled from source.

When you run the script, it will guide you through the process of setting up and launching the attack, including asking for the necessary parameters such as target IPs and wordlists.

Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and authorized security testing purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool to attack networks or systems that you do not own or have permission to test is illegal.


By using this tool, you agree to use it responsibly and only for purposes you have authorization for.
